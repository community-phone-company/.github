# Community Phone

Community Phone has a straightforward mission: make the phone call more powerful. We make it easy for people and businesses to talk. We build voice applications like call-center phone trees and spam-call blocking directly into the network - so there's no new habits or software for the customer to learn. We can do this because we are the nationwide carrier. We believe this is the simplest way to do voice in the age of the internet.
